I have included a Makefile to run compile and run the code running 'make' and you can clean all .class files with 'make clean'
you can also compile yourself with 'javac A3Client.java' and then 'java A3Client' which is located in the same folder as comp2150

I also have unused imports in my A3client and unused extensions since other intefaces brought them in already and the instructor assured me this was fine.

to create a hotel the txt file should be in the same format as the other assignments and should be in the same folder as comp2150, there is an example file "hotel.txt"

A2Client - has main method runs client code
